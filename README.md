# SOC Workflow & Process Flowchart

## Overview
This document gives an overview of the **Security Operations Center (SOC) Workflow & Process Flowchart**. It covers best practices, roles, and key performance indicators (KPIs). The goal is to keep SOC documentation organized, improve incident response, and align with security standards like NIST, ISO 27001, and CIS Controls.

## Workflow Breakdown
The SOC workflow follows a **cyclical incident response model**, making sure threats are always being monitored. Each phase outlines specific roles and performance metrics.

### 1. **Threat Detection & Triage**
   - **Who’s Responsible:** SOC Tier 1 Analysts
   - **What Happens:** Monitoring SIEM alerts, IDS/IPS triggers, and reviewing logs
   - **Key Metric:** Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)

### 2. **Incident Escalation & Analysis**
   - **Who’s Responsible:** SOC Tier 2 Analysts
   - **What Happens:** Investigating threats, analyzing malware, and checking threat intelligence
   - **Key Metric:** Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)

### 3. **Remediation & Containment**
   - **Who’s Responsible:** SOC Tier 3 Analysts / Incident Response Team
   - **What Happens:** Containing threats, applying fixes, and mitigating risks
   - **Key Metric:** Containment Time

### 4. **Reporting & Documentation**
   - **Who’s Responsible:** Incident Manager
   - **What Happens:** Performing root cause analysis (RCA), ensuring compliance, and writing incident reports
   - **Key Metric:** Incident Closure Rate

### 5. **Post-Incident Review & Improvement**
   - **Who’s Responsible:** SOC Leadership / Security Governance Team
   - **What Happens:** Conducting lessons learned meetings, improving processes, and updating security policies
   - **Key Metric:** Continuous Improvement Metrics

## Compliance & Standardization
- **Incident Response Playbooks**: Based on **NIST 800-61 Incident Response Guidelines**.
- **SLA, MOU, and MOA Standardization**: Defines clear **SOC service expectations**.
- **Security Awareness & Reporting**: Helps workforce members report security incidents properly.

## Usage & Implementation
- This workflow is useful for **training new SOC analysts**, improving **incident response**, and maintaining **consistent security processes**.
- The **flowchart helps teams coordinate better and make informed decisions**.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding **automated incident response playbooks**.
- Expanding into **cyber threat intelligence workflows**.
- Improving KPIs based on **real-time SOC performance data**.
